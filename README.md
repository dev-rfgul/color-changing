![Color Changing Background](https://socialify.git.ci/dev-rfgul/color-changing/image?language=1&name=1&owner=1&stargazers=1&theme=Auto)

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that allows users to change the background color dynamically. It consists of an HTML file for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

## Features

- Start button: Initiates the background color change animation.
- Stop button: Stops the background color change animation and retains the current background color.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Click the "Start" button to initiate the background color change animation.
4. Click the "Stop" button to stop the animation and retain the current background color.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: HTML structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for controlling the background color change functionality.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## How It Works

The JavaScript code listens for click events on the "Start" and "Stop" buttons. When the "Start" button is clicked, it triggers a function that changes the background color at regular intervals. When the "Stop" button is clicked, it stops the interval and retains the current background color.
